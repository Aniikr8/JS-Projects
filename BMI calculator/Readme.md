# BMI Calculator

This is a basic BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator project developed using JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to strengthen my foundational JavaScript skills.

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on user input for weight and height.
- Display the BMI value and corresponding category (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity).
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-calculator.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
2. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the JavaScript function calculates the BMI using the formula:
    ```
    BMI = weight / (height * height)
    ```
3. The calculated BMI is displayed along with the corresponding category:
    - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
    - Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
    - Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 29.9
    - Obesity: BMI >= 30

## Technologies Used
